## IV POLISH JUMPSTYLE MEETING

28-mar-2009

Shufflers met at the HUGE polish jumpstyle meeting. A meeting so huge that just being in the nearby streets of Krak√≥w you had a chance to meet either shuffler or jumper everywhere without even recognizing at this point most of the dancers because there were so many of them at the meeting.
A Bass Agents representative from Malaysia has even paid a visit.

## TOURNAMENT at POLISH SHUFFLE MEETING in ≈Å√ìD≈π

25-aug-2012

1st place: Samurai
2nd place: Ma≈Çy
3rd place: Neville

The tournament has not been officially titled as a Polish Shuffle Championship, probably due to not taking place on the forum anniversary meeting, however later it has been speculated whether it should have received a status of PSC. This might have led to the misinformation about the 3rd PSC‚Äôs name (described later).
There are stories about the final of this tournament requiring multiple overtimes (even 4 according to some) due to such a close level of the two final competitors.

## III POLISH SHUFFLE CHAMPIONSHIP (also mistaken for IV POLISH SHUFFLE CHAMPIONSHIP)

    6-jun-2015

1st place: RazieLL
2nd place: Loxin
3rd place: Miszel

There is some misinformation on whether this tournament was the 3rd or the 4th Polish Shuffle Championship. RazieLL‚Äôs and Miszel‚Äôs videos were originally titled as the 3rd PSC, the title was changed later to 4th. I have collected no data regarding what could be a polish championship between this tournament and the 2nd PSC, therefore I would suggest that this one was the official 3rd PSC.

## FREEDOM PARADE 2022

    30-jul-2022

After decades, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ has seen the return of the Freedom Parade in 2022. The street parade full of electronic music gathered many people to dance and have fun. Szufla, one of the oldest shufflers (yet active to this day) had a pleasure to be a DJ during this event. During his set, the carriage where he played was full of shufflers giving their best to perform for the people.

## FREEDOM PARADE 2023

26-aug-2023

A year later the new custom of shufflers performing in the carriage next to the DJ during the parade seems to be created.

A STORY OF THE POLISH COMMUNITY:

Jumpstyle community arised in Poland a bit earlier than Shuffle community. Many people found out about shuffle through Jumpstyle.

JUMPSTYLE > HARDSTYLE MUSIC > SHUFFLE

Shufflers mainly had 2 meetings a year: - melbshuffle.pl forum anniversary meeting (february/march) in Katowice
(which was probably the biggest polish shuffling city)

- summer meet-up happening in a different polish city every time

  - Christmas meeting (added to the list of regular yearly meetups later)

Due to Jumpstyle‚Äôs bigger community and popularity at the time, shufflers often attended polish Jumpstyle meetings as those were happening much more often. The music was not the problem because Jumpstyle is mainly danced with hardstyle music.
Such situation created a bond between the polish Jumpstyle and Shuffle communities. Many jumpers knew the basics of shuffle and shufflers knew the basics of jumpstyle.
After years the bond has slowly started getting weaker, communities became more different. The reasons could be shuffle no longer being danced only to hardstyle music, cutting shapes arrival and the shuffle community growth to the point where it outgrown the jumpstyle community.
Nowadays, polish shuffle and jumpstyle communities are not close to each other, however there are still those who practice both dances and are a part of both communities and that‚Äôs what keeps the last link between the two.

Even though a huge influence of the russian scene could be noticed at certain point in time and both polish and russian scene seemed very similar to each other (also through the same jumpstyle-shuffle bond), it was not necessarily a RUS style that Poland has taken from russians. What we took was more of a motivation/inspiration to create. I believe this motivation was important for the creation of events and tournaments that we‚Äôve had.

A video of Reece explaining the history of shuffling on one of the shuffle meetings in ≈Å√≥d≈∫:
https://youtu.be/iDUv6AfNt1k?si=GLUJO6RGYIaW5iPt

Polish shuffle community started around the melbshuffle.pl forum founded by Miniol. However, later it transitioned to Facebook to keep up with the popular trends and bring more people in. The forum times have brought few interesting ideas that have later died with the forum‚Äôs death.

POLISH SHUFFLE LEAGUE

Much like jumpers, shufflers have also had their online leagues named Polish Shuffle League. The idea has not become such a huge trend as in jumpstyle world, where internet leagues has overtaken all the community‚Äôs attention for years, but there have been 3 editions of PSL. Every league has been organized on melbshuffle.pl forum.

https://youtu.be/iaxbDfEBERE?si=v3wRTSHlMdY7fBlK
https://youtu.be/2VxQUWsjtxY?si=Ke-5jWxQIISAjOBV

SHUFFLE BATTLES

Another interesting part of the forum were shuffle battles. Shufflers were able to call somebody out any time and if the challenged dancer agreed to a duel, they both had a short amount of time to upload their dance videos. A set of judges appointed to judging those battles was then making their job and crowning the winner, providing a consstructive feedback for the dancers in the process.

After the years of forum being completely abandoned due to transition to FB, few top polish shuffling figures have asked the forum owner Miniol for the database in order to keep the historic archives of the polish shuffling. Unfortunately, they have met with the refusal, unless paying a certain amount of money for the knowledge that many of them helped creating. This led to a point where after the forum got closed, a huge part of knowledge has been gone. (Not entirely though. Certain snapshots of melbshuffle.pl can be found on archive.org.)

A facebook group called originally Melbourne Shuffle Poland, now with the name Shuffle Poland (many believed that the group‚Äôs name change was very crucial in bringing more people to the community) has gathered a number of 1,7k people in it.
Another important Facebook place that belonged to the community is a fanpage - Shuffle Poland. Both of those have gathered a great popularity and played a huge role in making shuffle much bigger in Poland.

#VOTM
One of the most interesting FB group ideas was VOTM - Video Of The Month. Shufflers would post their videos on the group with a hashtag ‚ÄúVOTM‚Äù and then at the end of the month there was a voting and the top 3 videos of the month were chosen.

examples:

Shuffle Poland has always made sure that the new generations know the history and the shuffle theory well enough. Helping each other both in person and online. The community has included specialists for every shuffling style always willing to teach others.
Firstly, people were learning a lot thanks to the melbshuffle.pl forum and then they were learning through the Shuffle Poland FB group. There has also been a special group dedicated precisely for learning, with fundamental tutorials in the description & specialists advising and recording their own tutorials for the young dancers.

One of the most important theories specifically focused on in Poland is the upper body/groove theory. Through mostly two tutorials recorded by Kapi, polish community has always been able to learn how to correctly work with the upper body in RM and T-step (which can be further applied to all the rest of the steps and tricks):

Another important polish tutorial is Malaysian Shuffle Basics tutorial by Konziu:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFVnjvdx9L0

Due to a growing problem of fake shuffle teachers in Poland, many real shufflers (i.e. GruszeQ, Konziu, Szufla) have decided to start giving classes.

After many years Poland has also come to the point of seeing purely shuffle dedicated school, based in Wroc≈Çaw - shuffledance.pl
https://www.instagram.com/shuffledance.pl/
https://www.facebook.com/shuffledancestudio

The rebirth:
After ‚ÄòHighflow generation‚Äô has started to slowly disappear from the scene around 2019, there has been a moment where the new generation has not really formed and for the first time it seemed like there is no one to take the polish scene from the lead of the former generation. 2021 has seen a birth of the new Warsaw community which has quickly gathered whole polish shuffling around it. Young shufflers started appearing in every part of Poland again and unite during (mostly) Warsaw meetups at the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski Bridge by the Wis≈Ça river. Soon most active Warsaw dancers have formed a team called Ravenants. Shortly after they would form a bond with shuffledance.pl community on the other side of Poland, where community started growing shortly after. Even though there are many cities with young active shufflers, the biggest communities remain in Warsaw and Wroc≈Çaw. Both places have started organizing events, firstly on a scale of the country and later expanding abroad by welcoming guests from other parts of the world.

Why was Shuffle Poland important?

I believe that polish shuffle community has always found a way to bring to the scene what the scene needed. And that is connecting all parts of shuffle dance in a perfectly balanced combination.
Even though Poland did not create a national style of shuffling, they‚Äôve created an APPROACH that makes people find their own style while staying true to shuffle nature. Thanks to this some of the most unique shuffle dancers in the world have been created.
It happened through:

- respect for the history of shuffle
- prioritization of strong fundamentals
- investing in community (keeping it both underground and true to its nature and reaching out to the outside world through different methods i.e. social media, shuffle schools)
- huge focus on being authentic
- encouraging creativity
- strong focus on the music (polish community was always strongly focused on a proper understanding of every track and finding a way to make dancing to it look most accurate - understanding all the structure and character of the song; not only ‚Äòmechanical‚Äô catching of different sounds)

TEAMS/CREWS:

Poland has always cultivated the team culture in shuffling. We have also went through the ‚Äòpokemon badge‚Äô phase

There were many teams in Poland with their number decreasing over years but I will only go through the most important ones. Every single one of those teams has been responsible for the overall high level of the polish scene as they‚Äôve featured most skilled shufflers from the country united together boosting themselves to grow all the time.

Hardstyle Republic

German community is said to have had the first officially approved non-malaysian Hardstyle Republic branch. Part of which was a polish shuffler living in Germany - Puma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LbLusTywMs (this video could be treated as a proof)

Through the communication with Puma, one of the most significant MAS style polish shufflers - Dazz has become able to open a polish branch of Hardstyle Republic.
Shortly after it would become a leading polish faction featuring shufflers like: Dazz, MYUi/Samurai, Nervarien, Ma≈Çy, Energy, Maciacho and more. Besides representing polish finest skills HR PL has also found their way on huge stages where they performed for the popular artists significant in shuffling communities over the world, such as Organ Donors or Headhunterz.

https://www.youtube.com/@HRPoland

Shaman Shuffle Power

Originated on 17th of November 2010 - Shaman Shuffle Power has been a team of shufflers centered around the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ but it quickly spread all over the country, motivated by the vision of equaling the Hardstyle Republic. They are also responsible for many performances, bringing the popularity to polish shuffle scene and doing much for the community, organizing meetups included.
SSP was also known for the team rank system. Every member had a rank which could be raised through skill and commitment. Members of the team were even checked in terms of how many shuffle movies they study or if they try to expand their knowledge further than just the national scene. The rank would be typed before their nickname with the sign ‚Äò/‚Äô. More slashes would mean higher rank. Top rank would be ‚Äò///‚Äô.
SSP has featured known polish shufflers such as: Szufla, Reece, Arcade, ≈ª√≥≈Çwiu, Kapi, Miszel, RaZieLL, Xero and more.

Highflow

Founded by Samurai, Highflow has not been an only polish team, but much like its founder it has its strong roots in Poland and the polish part of it was a very solid and unique crew. The main goal seemed to be elevating shuffling to a level where it could be put in the conversation with other huge dance styles. Simplified - the idea was to ‚Äúmake shuffling a DANCE‚Äù. No more mindless movements repetition, much focus on the music and working with it in a way that would move the hearts of the viewers. The people realizing that ‚Äòproject‚Äô were just the right people for the job because Highflow members were highly skilled great technical dancers, who know their craft - shuffle, properly and on such a strong base with everyone‚Äôs creative potential, they were able to create something more out of this.
Due to growing popularity highflow started selling their team logo merchandise:

Highflow has also launched a youtube channel with music for shufflers:

The crew‚Äôs love for the music has also gifted them a collaboration with Headhunterz.

One of Highflow‚Äôs projects was also creating an online shuffle tournament called Highflow Tenkaichi Tournament in 2016. The tournament had an unique concept of two different teams competing against each other and contestants having to face different creative tasks. The playlists with the tournament videos can be found on Highflow‚Äôs YT channel.

I believe that elevating shuffle to the level that Highflow did by showing a more of a dance approach built on strong shuffle foundations is one of the most important things that Poland has brought to the scene.

Ravenants

Partially responsible for the rebirth of the polish scene since 2021, Ravenants is a team of young polish shufflers originated around Warsaw and later spread across the country. The team is united by the underground vision of the dance which seems to be very often forgotten these days. Respect towards the history, technique, music and making sure that the true passion is there. The important goal of the team is also to grow together and have a strong focus on progress through the hard work.
Ravenants‚Äô team structure is quite an unusual one because it has never clearly highlighted any leader or rules. It is mostly about having similar principles in this dance which allows them to perfectly coexist and boost each other in shuffling.
Through the short time of the crew‚Äôs existence it has given few performances, showed their members off in some videoclips and is officially known as the organizer of the biggest yearly shuffle event in Poland these days - Summer Shuffle Cup.
It is also worth mentioning that despite its short existence, RV has already been a crew of probably the biggest number of international events/tournaments appearances.

INTERNATIONAL MEMBERSHIPS:
Of course, it is not a name of the crew ;)
Polish shufflers have often been members of famous international crews and it‚Äôs definitely worth mentioning.

Smaller polish crews and communities are also worth mentioning, since it all starts from the community and every person counts, therefore shoutout to: Hardstyle Revolution (HRev), East Side Dominators (ESD), Hard WaWa Shufflers (HWS) - old polish teams which did not get that big recognition but made sure to gather smaller local groups together and helped building the scene through uniting people.
Another shoutout: shuffledance.pl - about a decade later since the old times, a community in Wroc≈Çaw centered around the shuffle dedicated school has emerged. People from the community have also started promoting the dance, creating content and attending both national and international events.

MUSIC VIDEOS:

It seems to be the case that polish shufflers always find their way in some music videos. Below are some most popular examples:

‚óè Stachursky - FUNKY RIDER

Starring: Kapi, Taamiki, Konziu, Flap, Siemens, Miszel
Production: Neville

Famous polish music artist Jacek Stachursky has contacted Shuffle Poland for the collaboration for his new music video for a song ‚ÄòFUNKY RIDER‚Äô. Shuffle Poland has organized a nationwide shuffle meeting during which Stachursky‚Äôs crew was recording the music video:

51:45
1:11:00
(https://www.facebook.com/shufflepoland/videos/854062591412475)

Some technical issues caused shufflers to take matters in their own hands and led to Neville producing the whole video from the scratch, with the acting help of his shuffling friends. Stachursky is said to have loved the video and wanted to publish it, however some other complicated production issues from his or his label side caused the project to fail and the song has been released without a music video.
The clip, to this day, remains one of the coolest music videos dedicated to shuffling.

Polish scene has also appeared on the international scene a few times, starting with the international crews (such as Bass Neurotic or Bass Captives) and/or their polish branches, a huge international team - Highflow with its origins in Poland, tournaments abroad where polish shufflers served as judges (i.e. Kapi at United Dance Beat 2019 in Kiev, Ukraine) or took significant places
(i.e. Samurai winning PremoUK StompBattles
